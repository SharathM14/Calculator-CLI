# Calculator-CLI
Command-line calculator supporting basic operations.
This calculator program is written in Python and allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each operation is defined as a separate function to keep the code clean and modular. The program runs in a loop using while True, so it keeps asking the user for input until they choose to exit. A menu is displayed with numbered options for each operation and an exit choice. The user selects an option by entering a number, then inputs two numbers to perform the calculation. The program uses input() to take user input and float() to handle decimal values. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding function is called and the result is printed. If the user enters 5, the loop breaks and the program ends. It also includes error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero. This makes the calculator user-friendly and robust for basic math tasks.
